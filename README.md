LoremBikes is my first website project written in ReactJS. This app simulates bike shop website. It contains front-end layer. Data is served from my GitHub repository. Items in the shop have their own simple card, lists of items can be sorted by price, name, type. All bikes and accesories can also be added to simple shopping cart. Total value of items in the cart is calculated in real time. 

List of technologies: 
    - ReactJS (react, react-router-dom, hooks (useState, useParams, useEffect), custom hooks, react-responsive-carousel, react-icons)
    - HTML, CSS, SCSS
    = REST-API (app is simply connected with free online json service that gets data from my GitHub repository)
    - JAVASCRIPT (LocalStorage)
    - Git, GitHub

Website has been published and is currently available (14.10.2021) on https://vigilant-mcnulty-fd78c7.netlify.app/
