#### LoremBikes

## About
LoremBikes is my first website project written in ReactJS. This app simulates basic functions of online shop for bikes. Data is served from GitHub repository. Items in the shop have their own simple cards. List of items can be sorted by price, name, type. All bikes and accesories can also be added to simple shopping cart. Total value of items in the cart is calculated in real time. 

## How It works?
List of technologies: 

    - ReactJS (react, react-router-dom, hooks (useState, useParams, useEffect), custom hooks, react-responsive-carousel, react-icons)
    - HTML, CSS, SCSS
    - REST-API (app is simply connected with free online json service that gets data from my GitHub repository)
    - JAVASCRIPT (LocalStorage)
    - Git, GitHubgi
